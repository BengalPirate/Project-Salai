## Hello!
If you have an Onshape account (it's free) I encourage you to use [this link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f956b8696b5d699caf19dba1/w/29adebc65d9b66fde4088850/e/45770c1287d2a0914b11408e?renderMode=0&uiState=66070898eaef14224b7b165d) to edit these files directly to your specifications.

Please note: all files/models are rough around the edges (and I don't mean fillets lol), and fitment isn't perfect.
I will rerelease an improved instrument dock as part of my broader efforts to create a complete robotic system!
Any major file releases will accompany a video being published, so check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BennettStirton) if you haven't already.

And if you've made it this far and are curious why you keep seeing the project name _Salai_, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sala%C3%AC) your answer :) 

Best Wishes,
Bennett
